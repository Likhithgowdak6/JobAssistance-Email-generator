# Job Scraper and Cover Letter Generator

This project is a Python script that automates the process of scraping job descriptions from a website, extracting job details in JSON format, and generating a personalized cover letter based on the job description. It uses the `langchain_groq` library to interact with an LLM for text processing and `pandas` to handle portfolio data.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Loads job descriptions from a specified webpage.
- **Job Data Extraction**: Extracts structured job information (role, experience, skills, description) from the scraped content in JSON format.
- **Cover Letter Generation**: Generates a personalized cover letter based on the job description and linked portfolio projects.
  
## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required Libraries:
  - `langchain_groq`
  - `langchain_community`
  - `langchain_core`
  - `pandas`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install langchain_groq langchain_community langchain_core pandas
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **API Key Configuration**:
   Replace the placeholder in `groq_api_key='your_api_key'` with your actual Groq API key in the script.

3. **Prepare Portfolio Links**:
   Place a CSV file named `my_portfolio.csv` in the project directory with your portfolio information structured as follows:

   | Techstack        | Links                                         |
   |------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
   | Java             | file:///path/to/java-portfolio                |
   | Python           | file:///path/to/python-portfolio              |
   | Machine Learning | file:///path/to/ml-portfolio                  |

   Update the `portfolio_file` variable if your file is named differently.

## Usage

Run the script by executing:
```bash
python script_name.py
```

The script performs the following steps:
1. Loads job posting data from a specified webpage.
2. Extracts job details and outputs them as JSON.
3. Loads portfolio links from the CSV file.
4. Generates and prints a cover letter tailored to the job description and your skills.

## Code Overview

- **load_page_content**: Loads content from the job listing webpage.
- **extract_job_info**: Extracts structured job information as JSON using a prompt template.
- **load_portfolio_links**: Reads portfolio links from a CSV file.
- **generate_cover_letter**: Generates a personalized cover letter based on job description and portfolio links.
